Data I am going to use to solve the described problem will be:

-> Foursquare location data:
       Foursquare provides the majority of information that is interesting for me such as:
       
              - Cafes/restaurants
              - Shops
              - Culture
              - Parks
              - Gyms
              - Bus/trains
 I will be collecting and exploring the different venues using my developer account and put them into a readable format (pandas dataframe).
 
As I would like to now how to get the above information for each city I need to provide the exact location data, latitude and longitude and potentially scale down on the different neighourhoods of each city. I am concentrating on neighbourhoods near the city centres as this is where either of the workplaces would be. To do this I will ne working with the below:

-> geopy data for the geographical details of both Frankfurt and Brussels,
-> Geojson file 'world-cities' provided by Geonames, to get exact geographical information.
-> Wikipedia: List of neighbourhoods in each city.


Since I am not familiar with either city, I would like to see where the venues are located, so I will need a map that I can work with to give me an idea of the location of each venue:

-> Folium maps:
              - Visualize the different venues in each city/neighbourhood
 
I'd like to cluster the data that I have retrieved above, to give me an even better understanding of what I am about ot expect from the venues' location, e.g. is there a particular neighbourhood that has a large number of restaurants that interest me?
I will be using k-means to retrieve this details:

-> K-means:
              - Clustering details
              

At the end I will have two maps, one for each city, that clearly show clusters of the various venues that I have listed above and which will help me make a decision of which city will be the better place to live for me.
