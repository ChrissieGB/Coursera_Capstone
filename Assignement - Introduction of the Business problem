Capstone project: 'Battle of the Neighbourhoods':

BREXIT - What to do next?


The problem I am discussing and hopefully be solving in this project is a real world issue for many people , even though this particular case is fictive.

I am a European citizen in London, have been working for a financial institution for many years but, which is now, after Brexit, in the process of outsourcing their operations to a city within the EU and has therefore layed off many of their employees, me and my friends included.

With uncertain future opportunities in London, I have decided to look for jobs elsewhere, successfully as it turned out as I now have two offers for similar roles with comparable packages, both from companies I would like to work for. 
The problem is, one of the companies is located in Paris, France, the other one in Frankfurt, Germany.
I am not familiar with either of the locations (I exclude the language issues from this problem).

I don't want to give up my current lifestyle, neither do my friends who are in similar situations.
The neighbourhood of London I currently live in provides everything that I need, so my job choice will depend on the circumstances and opportunities in the new location, Frankfurt or Paris. 
I will decide on the city/neighbourhood that provides most of the requirements I and my friends have:

 - Public transport -> I do not have/want a car, so my new workplace and home as well as other venues need to be connected by a  public transport system.

 - Cafes/restaurants -> I have no time to cook, I need to pick up my breakfast on the way to work, lunch during my break and have a choice of different restaurants near my new home for dinner with friends.

 - Gyms or leisure centers -> sport is important to me so I need a gym either in the vicinity of my new home or my workplace.

 - Culture -> are there museums, theaters nearby that I can visit on the weekends?

 - Greens -> any parks? Remember, I don't have a car so it must be reachable by bus or train.

 - Doctors -> where is the nearest doctor/dentist? 

 - Savety, reputation -> how save is the neighbourhood? Are there any 'no go' areas, filthy nightclubs etc nearby?

 - Surprises? Any other things that I haven't thought of that may attract or deter me?


I will use the location data from Foursquare to compare and visualize the points above for both cities and find a neighbourhood that would be my choice to live in.
